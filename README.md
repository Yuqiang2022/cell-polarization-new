run A1_Framework_setup to build a 2D structure model of cells.
run A2_Physical_Parameters to set the mechanical parameters for the subcellular components.
run A3_Calculation to move the vertexes and proceed cell polarization.
run BB_Plot_shape to show the polarized morphology of the cell.
The default setting may obtain the results of cell polarization in Fig.2. By changing the structural and mechanical parameters, the other results can be obatained.
